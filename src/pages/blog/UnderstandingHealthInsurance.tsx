          <h2>Introduction to Health Insurance in New Zealand</h2>
          <p>
            Health insurance in New Zealand operates within a unique hybrid system that combines public and private healthcare. While the public system provides essential services to all New Zealand residents, private health insurance offers additional benefits, faster access to treatment, and greater choice in healthcare providers. This comprehensive guide will help you understand the intricacies of health insurance in New Zealand and make informed decisions about your healthcare coverage.
          </p>

          <h2>The New Zealand Healthcare System: Public vs Private</h2>
          <h3>Public Healthcare System</h3>
          <p>
            New Zealand's public healthcare system, funded through general taxation, provides universal access to essential health services. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Emergency care</li>
            <li>Hospital services</li>
            <li>Primary healthcare subsidies</li>
            <li>Maternity care</li>
            <li>Mental health services</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While the public system offers comprehensive coverage, it often involves waiting lists for non-urgent procedures and limited choice in healthcare providers. This is where private health insurance becomes valuable for many New Zealanders.
          </p>

          <h3>Private Healthcare System</h3>
          <p>

          <ul>
            <li>Shorter waiting times for elective procedures</li>
            <li>Choice of specialists and hospitals</li>
            <li>Private hospital rooms</li>
            <li>Advanced treatment options</li>
            <li>Coverage for non-funded medications</li>
          </ul>
