                    Health insurance is not mandatory in New Zealand because we have a public healthcare system. However, private health insurance can provide faster access to treatment, choice of specialists, and coverage for services not fully covered by the public system. About 30% of New Zealanders have some form of private health insurance.

                    Yes, you can have multiple health insurance policies in New Zealand.

However, you typically can't claim the same expense from multiple insurers.

                    Basic health insurance plans typically don't include dental coverage. Dental care is usually available as an optional extra or as part of comprehensive plans.
